# flutter_okhttp

A flutter plugin for making HTTP calls backed by OkHttp under native Android from within Dart/Flutter.

The cause for this projects existence is ultimately so that I can make HTTP calls from Dart/Flutter that trust certificates signed by a given custom certificate authority and to do so regardless if the hostname matches the certificate. There's a better way to describe this project and it needs to be actually documented. That will have to come later.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter
[plug-in package](https://flutter.dev/developing-packages/),
a specialized package that includes platform-specific implementation code for
Android and/or iOS.

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
